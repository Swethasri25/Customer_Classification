Here the dataset used is “German Credit” dataset. The German Credit data set(available at ftp.ics.uci.edu/pub/machine-learning-databases/statlog/) contains observations on 30 variables for 1000 past applicants for credit. 
Each applicant was rated as “good credit” (700 cases) or “bad credit” (300 cases). The dataset is about the customers eligible for the loan or not. If he/she eligible for the loan then the variable will be 1 or otherwise 0. 
Using different Algorithms, we can find the accuracy of the data set. We can also find the optimal algorithm for this dataset and confusion matrix.
